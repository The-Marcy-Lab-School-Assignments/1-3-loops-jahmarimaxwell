# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
You can change the "i < 10" to "i <=7" and this will keep the for loop running until i is equal to seven, just as the previous code.

Example:
```js
for (let i = 0; i <=7; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```
