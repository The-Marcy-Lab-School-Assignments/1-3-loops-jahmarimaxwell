# Question
In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer
A while loop is good for doing something as long as a certain condition is met, this can be performed an infinite amount of times. Thus, the main reason why a while loop is better is because of the amount of times it can perform. A for loop can change the amount of iterations, or one would have to set the iterations.
